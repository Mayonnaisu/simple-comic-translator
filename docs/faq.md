## FAQ
1. **How to change detector, ocr, translator, etc?**<br>
    You can't, unless you modify the source code yourself. Or just use the aforementioned alternatives. You can change [Gemini model](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/model-versions#gemini-auto-updated) in **config.json** tho.

2. **Is the app vibe coded?**<br>
    Yeah, mostly. I still have to manually review, modify, fix, and assemble the parts to the best of my abilities, as someone with basic programming skills tho. Also, I didn't use any coding agent. Instead, I search for the functions I need on Google and then check out the AI Overview or AI Mode when necessary. I also didn't one-shot it, but built it gradually on different occasions.

    Honestly, I'm interested in coding agents, but I haven't had a chance to try them yet. Idk, I just don't feel like completely leaving all the coding to such tool yet. Not to mention that they seem not so reliable (yet) anyway. Relying too much on such automation tool will just rob me of the learning opportunity I need at my current level. Either way, I don't think it's a good idea to blindly trust LLMs, which are prone to hallucination. You need to review the code they generated, but if you don't have any programming skills, how can you?

    I'm going to be honest with you, AI may not be perfect and prone to making mistakes here and there, but it has been of such great help to me. It makes me type so much less when I have f*cked-up hands due to injuries I got from working out and doing combat sports back when I was younger. I have tried voice coding, but, damn, it was so hard to get it to correctly type what I want.

3. **Where to learn programming/coding?**<br>
    There are a lot of free/paid courses out there. I will just recommend some sites I use/d (free):
    - [Sololearn (app)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sololearn)
    - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
    - [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
    - [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)

    I started from Web Development, then Python. But I think it's better to start from Python cuz it's fewer things to learn for a newbie (Python vs HTML+CSS+JavaScript).

4. **Why use the term "script kiddie"?**<br>
    Why not? If you're familiar with manga/hwa/hua and such, you will know there are a lot of stories with "villain"/"evil"/"demon"/etc as MCs. Most of the time, they are not actually that bad, or even bad at all. So, I was inspired to take the commonly bad nickname in IT. See: https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/49932/is-there-a-word-for-a-rookie-computer-programmer & https://web.archive.org/web/20251112113747/http://catb.org/jargon/html/S/script-kiddies.html.

    In real life, I saw that it was also used by some "senior" programmers to insult programmers who rely on 3rd party libraries/packages/modules instead of writing everything from scratch. Heh, pretty accurate, I guess X'D.

    Anyway, if you're so worried, you're free to scan & analyze my app. It's open source and for everyone to check out without anything hidden from my side.
